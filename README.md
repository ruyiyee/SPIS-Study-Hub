# SPIS-Study-Hub

Dear Students,

The Student Parliament is excited to announce the creation of a shared study resources database designed to support all students across CLS, IGCSE, and IB!

As a current IB student, I’ve gathered many resources—my own notes, useful websites, and online textbooks—that greatly helped me throughout CLS and IGCSE. I’ll be sharing these materials here, and I warmly invite my friends in IB, as well as IGCSE and CLS students who are willing to contribute, to take part in building this collaborative platform.

One thing that truly helped me over the years was keeping my files well-organized: it saves time, reduces stress, and makes studying far more efficient. I encourage everyone contributing to do the same, so our shared database stays easy to navigate and useful for everyone.

The Academic Department of the Student Parliament will coordinate and regulate the website to ensure its quality and accessibility. The purpose of this initiative is to create an open, reliable, and student-driven space where everyone can share knowledge.

As a former CLS and IGCSE student, I understand how valuable good resources can be, especially for independent studying. I truly hope this platform becomes a meaningful support system for us and helps us all achieve our well-deserved A*s and 7s in our final exams!

Warm regards,

Ruyi Ye
